/*
 * A parameter is no longer used by the method body
 * 
 * Remove it
 * 
 * - For the polymorphic method case, before remove parameter, should look into
 * other
 * implementations of the method. You might choose to add a separate method that
 * can
 * be used in those cases, but you need to examine how your callers use the
 * method to
 * see whether it is worth doing it
