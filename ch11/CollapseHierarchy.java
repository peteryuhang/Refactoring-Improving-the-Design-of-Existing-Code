/* 
 * A superclass and subclass are not very different
 * 
 * Merge them together
 * 
 * - Refactoring the hierarchy often involves pushing methods and fields up
 * and down the hierarchy. After you've done this you can well find you have
 * a subclass that isn't adding any value, so you need to merge the classes together
