## Putting It All Together

- Get know these refatorings still the beginning, because don't yet know when to use them and when not to, when to start and when to stop, when to go and when to wait. It is the rhythm that makes for refactoring, not the individual notes
- Refactoring is a learnable skill, the better way to learn it
  - **Get used to picking goal**
    - You aren't refactoring to pursue truth and beauty. You are trying to make your world easier to understand, to regain control of a program that is flapping loose
  - **Stop when you are unsure**
  - **Backtrack**
    - If you have refactored for an hour, it will take only about ten minutes to replay what you did
  - **Duets**
    - In refactoring, there is a premium on knowing when to quit. You partner will give your support for this
    - Refactoring first is less dangerous than adding new code
