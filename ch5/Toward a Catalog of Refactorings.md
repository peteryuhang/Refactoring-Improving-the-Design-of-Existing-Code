# Format of the Refactorings

Each refactoring has five parts:
- **Name**: Refacoring begin with a name
- **Summary**: The situation you need the refactoring and what the refactoring does
- **Motivation**: Why the refactoring should be done and when it shouldn't
- **Mechanics**: Step-by-step description of how to carry out the refactoring
- **Examples**: A very simple use of the refactoring to illustrate how it works

Patterns are where you want to be; refactorings are ways to get there from somewhere else <br>
